Linear Regression:

Regression is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between  a dependent and independent variable.
It involves graphing  a line over a set of datapoints that most closely fits the overall shape of data.

Uses of Linear Regression:
- Evaluating trends and sales estimate.
-  Analyzing impact of price changes.
- Assessment of Risk in financial services and insurance domain.

Understanding Linear  Regression Algorithm:

y = mx + c
Here, 
y = Dependent variable  / y-coordinate
x = Independent variable / x-coordinate
m = Slope of line
c = y-intercept

The line formed by y = mx + c in graph is know as Line of Linear Regression. It shows the relation between independent and dependent variables. 

If  independent and dependent variables are increasing then it forms +ve regression line as the slope is also +ve.
If independent variable is increasing and dependent variable is decreasing then it forms,  -ve regression line as slope is also -ve.

The distance between actual value and the estimated value(value that lies on the line of regression) is known as error.

Our main goal is to reduce the error i.e. to reduce the distance between estimated and actual value.

The line of regression  which has the least error  or the least difference in estimated value and actual value is known as best fit line.

Mathematical Formula:
To find slope:  m   = (submission of [(x - mean of x) * (y - mean of y)]) / (submission of (x - mean of x)^2)
To find y-intercept: c = mean value of y - (slope * mean value of x)

Now we can put the values of x, m and c in y = mx + c and predict the value of y. 

After that we need to reduce the error  between  actual and predictive value by checking goodness of fit from R-square  method.

R-Square Value: It is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.
In general, High R-square value  = Good model
However in some cases, we can have low R-square value for good model or high R-squared value for model that is not fit at all.

In some fields, it is entirely expected that R-squared  value  will be low  such as in the field that attempts to predict human behaviour typically has R-squared value lower than 50%.

The formula for R-squared = 1 - (sum of squares of resudual / total sum of squares)
